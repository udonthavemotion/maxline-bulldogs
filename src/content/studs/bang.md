  ‼️ 12 WEEK PUP-DATE ‼️
  🧠 HANNIBAL 🍽️
  “On a related note… I do wish we could chat longer.”
  But this isn’t a conversation.
  It’s a warning.

  He’s got the manners of a gentleman —
  but don’t let the bowtie fool you.
  There’s a monster behind the mask. 🎭🔪

  ⸻

  🧠 HANNIBAL 🍷 —
  12 weeks old and already carving his legacy like a fine cut of veal.
  Not raised… refined.
  Not just bred… cultivated.

  Precision in the structure. Violence in the blood.
  A symphony of savagery —
  Coming to take a bite out of America 🇺🇸
  We will uncage a thriller.

  ⸻

  🍽️ THIS PEDIGREE?
  It’s not just rare — it’s forbidden cuisine.
  The kind you savor once,
  and remember forever.
